## ‚ùî How to Use?

To run this project in your local environment, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/diyyo/finance-tracker.git
    cd finance-tracker
    ```

2.  **Create a Firebase Project**
    * Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    * Create a new project.
    * Inside the project, create a new Web App (click the `</>` icon).
    * Copy the provided Firebase configuration (`firebaseConfig`).

3.  **Configure Firebase in the HTML**
    * Open the `index.html` file.
    * Find the `<script>` tag at the bottom that contains `const firebaseConfig`.
    * Replace the existing `firebaseConfig` object with the configuration from your Firebase project.
    ```javascript
    const firebaseConfig = {
        apiKey: "...",
        authDomain: "...",
        databaseURL: "...",
        projectId: "...",
        storageBucket: "...",
        messagingSenderId: "...",
        appId: "...",
        measurementId: "G-..."
    };
    ```

4.  **Enable Google Sign-In**
    * In the Firebase Console, go to the **Authentication** section.
    * Select the **Sign-in method** tab.
    * Enable the **Google** provider.

5.  **Configure Admin (Optional)**
    * To access the admin panel, you need to register your account's UID.
    * Log in to the application once with the account you want to make an admin.
    * Go to the **Firebase Console** -> **Realtime Database**.
    * Create a new data structure with the path: `admin/uid`.
    * Set its value to be an array containing your admin account's UID as a string. Example:
    ```json
    {
      "admin": {
        "uid": [
          "ABcdeFGhIJkLMnOPqRSTuVwxyZ12345"
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

6.  **Run/Deploy the Application**
    * Open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.
    * For the best experience, it's recommended to use an extension like "Live Server" in Visual Studio Code to run a local development server.
